Got it — you want each section to be written in the same style as your Purpose & Value Proposition line: one clear, coherent, and sufficient sentence. Here’s a refined version of your slide:


---

How do I craft one for myself?

Purpose & Value Proposition
A personal value proposition explains to your ideal audience why you’re the right choice for a project, initiative, investment, or other opportunity.

Compelling Narrative
A compelling narrative shares your professional story in a clear and authentic way, connecting your past experiences, present strengths, and future aspirations.

Personal Brand Audit
A personal brand audit helps you understand how others currently perceive you, identify gaps with your desired image, and highlight areas for improvement.

Market, Evaluate & Adjust
Marketing, evaluating, and adjusting your brand ensures that you consistently communicate it across platforms, measure its impact, and refine it as you grow.

Would you like me to also make these more concise (like bullet-sized one-liners) so they’re easier to read during a presentation?
