Thanks! Here's the revised email incorporating that you worked in a coordinator/project management type of team, but would prefer a transition to a tech/SDE/SRE/DVF path:

Subject: Request for Nomination to Tech Roles in GTS

Dear [XYZ / Manager’s Name],

I hope you're doing well.

I’d like to take a moment to sincerely thank you for the opportunity to work as part of this team during my internship. Being involved in coordinator/project management-related responsibilities has given me a valuable perspective on how large-scale projects are driven, and I’m truly grateful for the exposure and guidance received throughout my time here.

As I now move into a full-time role, I wanted to express my aspiration to build my career in more technical domains — specifically in roles like Software Development, DVF, or SRE within GTS. My passion lies in solving technical problems, working hands-on with systems and code, and contributing directly to engineering-focused workstreams. I believe that’s where my strengths can be best utilized and nurtured in the long run.

If there's an opportunity for me to be considered or nominated for any open roles in such technical teams, I would be very grateful for your support. I'm eager to grow within GTS and contribute meaningfully in roles that align with my long-term goals.

Once again, thank you for all the learning and support during my time with the team — it has been a genuinely enriching experience.

Warm regards,
Gaurav Kumar Nandgowli

Would you like this to be a bit shorter or more casual depending on your relationship with the manager?

You're right — it can sound a bit too formal or flowery. Here's a more natural, grounded version of that paragraph:

I want to genuinely thank you for the opportunity to intern with this team. Working in a coordinator/project management capacity gave me useful exposure to how large-scale initiatives are run and helped me understand the broader picture of how things come together. I’ve learned a lot and really appreciate the support and guidance I received along the way.

Let me know if you want the whole email in a similar tone — slightly formal but real and to-the-point.
