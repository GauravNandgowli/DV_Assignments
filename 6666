Hi Sharan,

Thanks for the clarification.

To address your question — I did not check with the senior pilot on this ticket, as I was not aware that EEFB/EEFBM incidents also required escalation from my side. Since I am not yet trained on this process, I was unsure of the escalation flow and the SLA applicable for it.

My understanding so far has been that, as I work paired with a senior pilot, processes that I am not trained on are handled by them, and I focus on the areas where I am already trained and can independently take action. Accordingly, during my shift, I concentrated on the processes I am responsible for, and no additional alerts related to this ticket appeared on my end.

Thank you for highlighting the correct expectation — I will make sure going forward to acknowledge such tickets and check with the senior pilot or the on-call lead whenever I am unsure.

Please let me know if there are any specific interim guidelines I should follow for EEFB/EEFBM incidents until my training is completed.

Regards,
Gaurav Nandgowli

Why this works:

It directly answers his question (no avoidance).

It explains your reasoning without blaming anyone.

It stays professional, calm, and cooperative.

It shows openness to guidance, not defensiveness.


If you'd like, I can make it even more polished or slightly softer.
